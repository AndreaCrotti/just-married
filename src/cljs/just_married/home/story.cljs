   "Once upon a time,
  There was this girl, she was witty, a bit anarchic, and she had 4 big passions in life: books, wine, jazz, and travel. It was like she was affected by recurrent acute episodes of wanderlust; and in a very short time all that would move her horizons a bit further became her things. She led a busy life, she had friends all over the World, and a lot of interest, personal aspirations, and dreams to follow.
  Whilst she was so lost in wanders and wonders she did not notice at first that there was a guy. He was cute, although dressed funny, and he seemed a little silly. But underneath the dorky t-shirt found randomly in one of the many stalls of IT meetups, she could sense he had a big heart. She was very difficult to catch, but this did not discourage him. He just kept texting …a lot!
  There is no way to say what really brought them together. Perhaps it was her cooking. She had some sort of a magic touch. Everything seem to taste so much better than the usual “frittata with nothing”. Or maybe it was his kindness, he must have had a rulebook hidden somewhere of all the right things to say and do all the time. And even though she did remind him a few times “it is never going to work …you are a Gemini!!” the Stars could not do anything against Love.
  With time they learned that, at heart they were very similar, more similar that they could ever imagine and in their differences there was a new strength. He said once that she was the other half of his apple, she admitted he was not so bad either! It really did not take long for them to realise that they liked their closeness, and they learned to be truly themselves without getting lost in one another. There was no melancholy of the past because every day was a new discovery of what they were and not of what they could have been. It felt like the start of a new wondrous adventure…
