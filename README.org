* Just married

Pedestal and re-frame Clojure app to host the public facing part of a
wedding related website, and it's backend storing information about guests

* Versions

** v1
   DEADLINE: <2017-09-08 Fri>
   bare minimum to make the website public, which contains the basic information required,
   and some basic interaction like the RVSP, already multi lingual.

** v2
   DEADLINE: <2017-10-29 Sun>
   Extra interaction like music selection and similar other things.

** v3
   DEADLINE: <2017-12-31 Sun>
   More integrations and fun things, like mail/sms notifications and uploading your own pictures.

* TODO run tests in Circleci                              :infrastructure:v1:
** TODO run frontend tests in Circle

** TODO run backend tests
   This involves also finding a way to set up docker properly,
   to be able to run integration tests.   

* TODO use HTTPS everywhere                                  :infrastructure:
  This might potentially be expensive at least on Heroku, less so on Aws or digital ocean

* TODO register and use a nice DNS name                      :infrastructure:v1:
  - andreaenrica.life
  - andreaenrica.wedding (more expensive)

* User facing features

** TODO upload funny stories and pictures/videos of the two              :v2:
   getting married, so they can be told, attached somewhere during the
   wedding itself.

** TODO add an integration to add the date to the calendar               :v1:
   and ideally to set some reminders automatically as well

** TODO add a way to collect stories about the couple,                   :v2:
   which can be written out/told during the wedding itself

** TODO smart notifications via sms/email                                :v2:

** TODO accommodation suggestions                                        :v2:

   - [ ] try to get everything working with clojurescript without
     having to resort to use javascript directly

** TODO playlist suggestion                                              :v2:

- [ ] improve style for the countdown

** TODO few pictures in main gallery                                     :v1:

** TODO suggestions for gifts                                            :v2:

   - [ ] stripe/braintree integration
   - [ ] amazon wish list

** TODO feature to upload your own thoughts and images                   :v3:

Could use [Picasa WEB developer API](https://developers.google.com/picasa-web/) 
For clojure see [clj-dropbox ](https://github.com/aria42/clj-dropbox) instead.

** TODO language detection and translation (italian/english)             :v1:

** TODO nicely packaged android/ios app?                                 :v2:

** TODO authentication support                                           :v2:

* Backend features

** TODO research and implement some algorithm to generate the tables     :v2:

- [ ] add a "category" field to put families/people in?
- [ ] add information about the actual amount of tables and their shape/number of seats
- [ ] add a way to add extra constraints on families/people who should not be in the same table

* TODO google analytics                                      :infrastructure:

* TODO logentries                                               :infrastructure:

* TODO fill in the database with all the invited people importing from existing data :v1:
* TODO restrict the google maps key to avoid [[https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/key/226?authuser=0&project=getting-married-1499546104310&pli=1][quota thefts]]   :infrastructure:
* TODO add a way to run everything inside docker             :infrastructure:
  This would allow to possibly test running everything in AWS/ECS or
  even kubernetes in the google cloud otherwise.

* TODO add a re-captcha on input forms to avoid being spammed badly      :v1:

https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#site/338522954?setup

* TODO choose the right fonts                                   :graphics:v1:

Nice possible fonts to use:

- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Courgette
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface

* TODO Get the right structure and graphics                     :graphics:v1:

Check places like:

- https://www.behance.net/

* Database schema

- invited (every person invited):
  + age
  + name
  + dietary requirements
  + lunch/dinner flags (or in the family this one?)

- family (collection of invited people, sharing contact details)
  + O2M: invited
  + contact person
  + phone
  + email address
  + should be notified flag?
  + requires accommodation?

- table of events, collecting all the interactions such as:
  + rvsp yes
  + rvsp no
  + email sent
  + sms sent
  + song suggested

  How do we know who did what? Need some kind of basic authentication to keep track properly.
