* Just married

Pedestal and re-frame Clojure app to host the public facing part of a
wedding related website, and it's backend storing information about guests

* Versions

** v1
   DEADLINE: <2017-09-08 Fri>
   bare minimum to make the website public, which contains the basic information required,
   and some basic interaction like the RVSP, already multi lingual.

** v2
   DEADLINE: <2017-10-29 Sun>
   Extra interaction like music selection and similar other things.

** v3
   DEADLINE: <2017-12-31 Sun>
   More integrations and fun things, like mail/sms notifications and uploading your own pictures.

* Graphics

** TODO choose the right fonts

Nice possible fonts to use:

- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Courgette
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface

** TODO Get the right structure and graphics

Check places like:

- https://www.behance.net/

* Database schema

- invited (every person invited):
  + age
  + name
  + dietary requirements
  + lunch/dinner flags (or in the family this one?)

- family (collection of invited people, sharing contact details)
  + O2M: invited
  + contact person
  + phone
  + email address
  + should be notified flag?
  + requires accommodation?

- table of events, collecting all the interactions such as:
  + rvsp yes
  + rvsp no
  + email sent
  + sms sent
  + song suggested

  How do we know who did what? Need some kind of basic authentication to keep track properly.
